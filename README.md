# SlideReal - A slide-presentation engine for the web

## What does it do?

Currently, this application is in its formative stages and does nothing.  The
project's primary goal is to provide a mechanism for viewing slideshows in
church environments, which frequently employ full-screen slides for notes,
and various layouts (full-screen, subtitles) for music lyrics.
